# EddAlytics - Evmos Dex Dashboard Analytics

Providing a visual analytics front-end with rich information about the health and performance of Dex on Evmos ecosystem - Powered by Evmos x Covalent. 

### Intro
- Web3 has revolutionized monetary interactions through decentralized finance (DeFi), offering users various financial services akin to traditional banking, lending, insurance, and trading, without central authority reliance. Among these, decentralized exchanges (DEX) stand out, enabling direct wallet-to-wallet trades, facilitating currency exchange seamlessly.  

- DEX uses Automated Market Makers (AMMs), that allows users to swap tokens on DEX, by paying money from one currency to buy money for another eg. using US dollars stable coin (USDC) to buy Ethereum tokens (ETH). AMMs are protocols for DEXs that help give you the price between these two assets when you swap tokens. AMMs usually rely on a mathematical formula to price assets. Currently, there are different formulas that AMMs use however, the most fundamental and most well-known formula is the XY=K equation. XY=K is an equation you use for determining how much of one token, called X, is needed to swap for another token, called Y, in any DEX.

### Project mission 
- For the success of a DEX protocol, running on an XY=K engine, a visual analytics front-end dashboard is needed to provide users with rich information about the health and performance of that ecosystem. Emvos is a fast growing ecosystem with a decentralized exchange built in the ecosystem, thus we approach to solve the problem by providing  [EddAlytics](https://eddalytics.vercel.app/) - Evmos Dex Dashboard Analytics.

### Project Solution 
- Introducing [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/), they built XY=K: the suite of Class B, generalized UniswapV2-like endpoints in their unified API for exchange on various blockchains. They introduced these endpoints to provide you with the richest and most robust on-chain DEX data and allow you to retrieve all the required data for any UniswapV2-like protocol such as SpiritSwap and SushiSwap on a variety of blockchains by simply providing the name of the exchange and the correct chainID for the blockchain. As a result, these endpoints enable you to access any DEX-related protocol in a matter of minutes - Awesome right! 😊

## How to use 

### Get information about chain statuse and blocked Signed

API method `GET/v1/chains/status/` can be used to get information about chain statuse and blocked Signed at.
 - note: `const chainStatus = data?.data?.items[25].synced_block_height` at `[25]` we the get the chain id of Evmos in array of objects 😊

```js
const APIKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENTKEY;

export default function ChainStatus() {
  // used React-Query to fetch Covalent API
  const { data, error, isFetching } = useQuery(["chainStatus"], async () => {
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/chains/status/?key=${APIKey}`
    );
    return res.json();
  });
  const chainStatus = data?.data?.items[25].synced_block_height;
  const blockedSignedAt = data?.data?.items[25].synced_blocked_signed_at;
  
     if (isFetching)
    return "Loading..."

  if (error) "error + messaage"
    
}


```

### Get 30d volume and liquidity as a timeseries chart

API XY=K method `/v1/9001/xy=k/cronus/ecosystem/?&key=${APIKey}`can be used to get information on volume 7-30 days & liquidity 7-30 days
- notes: we simply provide the name of the exchange `/cronus/` and the correct chainID (9001 = Evmos_mainnet) `/9001/` for the blockchain. Lastly your Api key from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) you provided on .env.local as a variables `/?&key=${APIKey}` , as a result, these endpoints enable you to access any DEX-related protocol in a matter of minutes, cool hey 😊

```js
const APIKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENTKEY;

export default function CronusOverview() {
  // used React-Query to fetch Covalent API
  const { data, error, isFetching } = useQuery(["cronusEco"], async () => {
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/9001/xy=k/cronus/ecosystem/?&key=${APIKey}`
    );
    return res.json();
  });

  // Chart data for Evmos liquidity_chart_30d
  const CronusLiquidity = data?.data?.items[0].liquidity_chart_30d.map(
    (item) => ({
      X: moment(item.dt).format("MMM Do"),
      Y: item.liquidity_quote,
    })
  );

// Chart data for Evmos volume_chart_30d
  const CronusVolume = data?.data?.items[0].volume_chart_30d.map((item) => ({
    X: moment(item.dt).format("MMM Do"),
    Y: item.volume_quote,
  }));
  
   if (isFetching)
    return "Loading..."

  if (error) "error + messaage"
     
  }
```

### Get Top tokens by price volume liquidity

API XY=K method `/9001/xy=k/diffusion/tokens` can be used to get information on tokens by price, volume, liquidity, 
- notes: we simply provide the name of the exchange `/diffusion/` and the correct chainID (9001 = Evmos_mainnet) `/9001/` for the blockchain. Lastly your Api key from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) you provided on .env.local as a variables `/?&key=${APIKey}` ,as a result, these endpoints enable you to access any DEX-related protocol in a matter of minutes, Amazing right😊

```js
const APIKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENTKEY;

export default function CronusTokens() {
  // used React-Query to fetch Covalent API
  const { data, error, isFetching } = useQuery(["diffusionTokens"], async () => {
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/9001/xy=k/diffusion/tokens/?key=${APIKey}`
    );
    return res.json();
  });

  const items2 = data?.data?.items;
  
    if (isFetching)
    return "Loading..."

  if (error) "error + messaage"
   
}
```

### Get Top pools by price volume liquidity

API method `/9001/xy=k/evmoswap/pools` can be used to get information on tokens by price, volume, liquidity, 
- notes: we simply provide the name of the exchange `/evmoswap/` and the correct chainID (9001 = Evmos_mainnet) `/9001/` for the blockchain. Lastly your Api key from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) you provided on .env.local as a variables `/?&key=${APIKey}` ,as a result, these endpoints enable you to access any DEX-related protocol in a matter of minutes, Super great!😊

```js
const APIKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENTKEY;

export default function EvmoswapPools() {
  // used React-Query to fetch Covalent API
  const { data, error, isFetching } = useQuery(["evmoswapPools"], async () => {
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/9001/xy=k/evmoswap/pools/?key=${APIKey}`
    );
    return res.json();
  });

  const items = data?.data?.items;
  
 if (isFetching)
    return "Loading..."

  if (error) "error + messaage"
     
);
}
```

### Get transactions for account address

API XY=K method `/v1/9001/xy=k/evmoswap/tokens/address/0x181c262b973b22c307c646a67f64b76410d19b6b/transactions/` can be used to get transactions information on account address, which also includes these type of transactions eg. SWAP, ADD LIQUIDITY, REMOVE LIQUIDITY. 
- notes: we simply provide the name of the exchange `/evmoswap/` and the correct chainID (9001 = Evmos_mainnet) `/9001/` for the blockchain, and you will note that here we have account, an address, which represents evmoswap address - which will help us get all the transactions on this address. Lastly your Api key from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) you provided on .env.local as a variables `/?&key=${APIKey}` ,as a result, these endpoints enable you to access any DEX-related protocol in a matter of minutes, Nice!😊
- Development TIP! 💁‍♂️: when mapping through the data it comes in a decending list of array from old to new (old information on top of list and new information on the bottom), suggest you Use `map()` on an Array in Reverse Order in JS :
```js
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

const mapReverse1 = arr
  .slice(0)
  .reverse()
  .map(element => {
    return element;
  });

console.log(mapReverse1); // 👉️ ['c', 'b', 'a']

```


```js
const APIKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENTKEY;

export default function EvmoswapTransactions() {
  // used React-Query to fetch Covalent API
  const { data, error, isFetching } = useQuery(
    ["evmoswapTransactions"],
    async () => {
      const res = await fetch(
        `https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/9001/xy=k/evmoswap/tokens/address/0x181c262b973b22c307c646a67f64b76410d19b6b/transactions/?key=${APIKey}`
      );
      return res.json();
    }
  );

  const items = data?.data?.items;
  
   if (isFetching)
    return "Loading..."

  if (error) "error + messaage"
     
}
```
